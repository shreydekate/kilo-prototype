# kilo-prototype
 Minimal text editor built entirely in C. Used [snaptoken's kilo tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) as a starting point.

 ## Setup
 Make sure to run this in a Linux environment. If using Windows, download and use Bash.
 ```
make
./kilo [file_name - optional argument]
```

## Usage 
Ctrl+Q to quit, Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+F to find/search

## Future features to implement
- Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V
- Split screen?
- Text editor navigation commands that don't disappear 5 seconds after a keypress
- Support for other filetypes in terms of syntax coloring and highlighting
- More potential features suggested [here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/08.appendices.html#ideas-for-features-to-add-on-your-own)
